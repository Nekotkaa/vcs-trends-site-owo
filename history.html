    <h3>Summary of the pdf</h3>
    <p>Version Control Systems (VCS) have evolved over decades—from early centralized systems to today’s distributed tools.</p>
    1972: SCCS introduced basic change tracking.

1982: RCS added automated file versioning.

1986: CVS enabled collaboration through client-server architecture.

2000: Subversion (SVN) improved reliability with atomic commits.

2005: Git and Mercurial brought distributed version control—every developer has a full repository.

2008–2010s: GitHub and similar platforms made collaboration easier, leading Git to dominate the industry.
Today, Git is the global standard for software projects, powering both open-source and corporate development. The journey from SCCS to Git marks a shift from simple file backups to complex, distributed collaboration systems that support millions of developers.
