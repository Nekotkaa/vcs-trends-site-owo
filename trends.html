    <p>Modern trends in version control focus on automation, collaboration, and intelligence.

GitOps: Uses Git as the “single source of truth” for both code and infrastructure, integrating with deployment tools like ArgoCD or FluxCD.

CI/CD Integration: Every commit can trigger automatic builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring faster and safer releases.</p>

Cloud Platforms: Services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket make version control accessible anywhere, adding tools for code reviews, issue tracking, and team management.

AI in Development: Tools such as GitHub Copilot and AI-powered code reviewers help detect bugs, write code, and analyze repository history.
These trends make version control systems more powerful than ever—combining automation, scalability, and smart collaboration for modern software development.</p>
