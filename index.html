    <h3>Summary of the pdf</h3>
    <p>Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools in programming that help developers track, manage, and collaborate on code.
They record every change made to a file or project, allowing you to view past versions, undo mistakes, and work safely with others on the same codebase.
From individual developers to massive open-source projects, version control keeps everything organized and reliable.</p>
